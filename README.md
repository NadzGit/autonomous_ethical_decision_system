# autonomous_ethical_decision
A modular autonomous decision system for simulated (drone) surveillance, focusing on safety constraints, explanability and real-world operational limits.
As of now, I am focussing on learning and improving my modular design skills as well as learning software architecture. I am using a Clean Architecture adjacent architecture for this project.

More to come.
